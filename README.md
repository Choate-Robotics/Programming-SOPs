# Programming Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

In this repository we will create a series of documents that can be used to be a reference for current and future programmers on team 7407. Each document on here should be a short and easy to digest guide to some part of the process of adding to the code base of 7407. 

Some topics we are looking to add:

* Setting up a programming environment. This would include:
	- What IDE we generally use
	- How to setup a virtual environment
	- How to setup poetry
	- How to connect to GitHub
* GitHub Utilization
	- How to get a repo
	- How to make a branch
	- How make a pull request
	- Who reviews a pull request
* How to use the toolkit
	- What is in the toolkit
	- What do you need to make sure you use
* Our general robot file structure
