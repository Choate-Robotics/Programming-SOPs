IDE
===

What is an IDE?
---------------
* IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.
* An IDE is a program that is used to write code.
---------------

There are many IDEs that can be used to develop Python code.  The following are recommended:

VSCode
------
* The most popular IDE for our team.
* free and open source, and has a large community of developers.
* general purpose IDE that can be used for many different languages.
* very customizable and has a large number of extensions that can be used to add functionality.
* can be downloaded from (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

PyCharm
-------
* A very popular IDE for Python development.
* has a free community edition and a paid professional edition.
* More focused on Python development than VsCode.
* can be downloaded from (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

Vim
---
* Try if you dare.
* can be downloaded from (https://www.vim.org/download.php)
* how do i exit vim? Please help me.


Git and Github
==============
* Github is a website that hosts git repositories.
* We use Github to host our code and to collaborate with other developers.
* Github can be accessed at (github.com/Choate-Robotics)
.. important::

    Github is not the same as git.  Git is a version control system that is used to manage code.  Github is a website that hosts git repositories.
.. note::

    You will need to create a Github account to access our repositories. Let the current team leader know your Github username so you can be added to the organization.

**How to Install Git**
----------------------

1. Download Git from (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Run the installer

3. Verify Git is installed by opening a command prompt and typing 
    
.. code-block:: bash

    git

.. tip::

    **Github Desktop**
    * Github Desktop is a GUI for git that makes it easier to use.

    1. Download Github Desktop from (https://desktop.github.com/)

    2. Run the installer

    3. Open Github Desktop and sign in with your Github account

Other Software
==============

This is a list of other software that is used to develop code for FRC robots. its not exactly necessary to install these on every computer, but you can if you want.

* WPILIB Suite:
    
        * WPILIB Suite is a collection of tools that are used to develop code for FRC robots.
        * includes the WPILIB VSCode extension, Shuffleboard networktable reader, etc.

        .. important:: 

            * WPILIB Suite requires Java 11 to be installed.
