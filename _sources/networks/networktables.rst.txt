Networktables:
--------------

Networktables is a way for the RoboRIO to communicate with the driver station. It is used to send data to the driver station and to recieve data from the driver station. Networktables is used to send data such as the robot's position, the robot's speed, and the robot's angle. Networktables is also used to recieve data such as the joystick's position, the joystick's button presses, and the joystick's angle.

* We use Networktables to send data between other devices on the robot, the RoboRIO, and the driver station (EX: Limelight)
