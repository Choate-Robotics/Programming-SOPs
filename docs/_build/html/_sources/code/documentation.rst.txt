Code Documentation
==================

This page contains the links to the documentation of code from the toolkit, WPIlib, and other vendors that we use.

RobotPy and WPILib
------------------

* Robotpy and WPIlib contain most of the code that we use to program our robot, as well as contain more verbose information on how to develop robot code. 

.. caution:: 
    * The documentation for WPIlib is mostly in Java and C++, and does not contain much information on how to use the Python version of the library.
    * The documentation for RobotPy is not complete, and is still being worked on.

robotpy-toolkit-7407
--------------------

* The robotpy-toolkit-7407 is a library that we use to make programming our robot easier. It contains many functions that we use to make our code more readable and easier to write.

CTRE and REVRobotics
--------------------

* CTRE and REVRobotics are the two main vendors that we use for motor controllers and other electrical components and sensors.
