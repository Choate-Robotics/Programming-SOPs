Driver Station
==============

The driver station are designated computers that the team will use regularly to control the robot.

Setup
-----

If you need to set up a new driver station, you will need to install the following software:

* FRC Game Tools - for the driver station software
* FRC WPILIB Suite - for Shuffleboard and other utilities

.. caution:: 
    DO NOT BE FOOLED!
    while the amount of software you need to install is small, the installation process is long and the software is large. 
    Please allow yourself at least 30 minutes to install the software.
    **DO NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN INSTALL THE SOFTWARE IN 5 MINUTES!**
    
    * Also, make sure to test the software before competing. 
      You don't want to be caught with a non-functional driver station at a competition.
      The Event Organizers will give you a replacement as long as you ask.
