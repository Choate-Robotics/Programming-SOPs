Git and Github
==============

What is it?
-----------

Git is a version control system. It allows you to keep track of changes to a project over time. It also allows you to collaborate with others on a project.

.. hint:: 

    * Think of it as a google doc for code with a few exceptions:
        * You have to manually save your changes. **This is called a commit.**
        * You have to manually sync your changes with the server. **This is called a push.**
        * You can't see other people's changes until they sync them with the server. **This is called a pull.**

    * Now take that google doc and imagine that you can see every change that has ever been made to it. You can see who made the change, when they made it, and what they changed. You can also revert back to any previous version of the document. **This is the Git commit history.**

    * Now imagine that you can make a copy of the document, make changes to it, and then merge those changes back into the original document. You can also merge changes from other people's copies of the document into your copy. **This is branching and merging.**

How do I use it?
----------------

There are two ways to use Git. You can use it from the command line or you can use a GUI. The GUI is easier to use, but the command line is more powerful. 

.. note:: 
    both methods utilize the same commands, meaning switching from one to another is not too challenging. The GUI just makes it easier to visualize what is happening.


.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: GUI
        :sync: GUI

        GUI

        Github Desktop is a GUI for Git. It makes it easy to see what changes you have made and to sync them with the server. It also makes it easy to create branches and merge them back into the main branch.

        .. note::
            You can download Github Desktop `here <https://desktop.github.com/>`_.

        You can Clone repositories at the top right...

    .. tab-item:: CLI
        :sync: CLI
        Command Line (CLI)


        The command line is a text based interface to your computer. It is a powerful tool that allows you to do many things that you can't do with a GUI. It is also a bit more complicated to use, since you have to remember the commands.

        .. note:: 
            If you are using a Mac, you can open the terminal by pressing command + space and typing terminal. If you are using Windows, you can open the command prompt by pressing the windows key and typing cmd.

        Here are some basic commands to get you started:

        .. tab-set::

            .. tab-item:: Windows
                :sync: Win

                * ``cd`` - change directory

                * ``dir`` - list files in current directory

                * ``mkdir`` - make directory

                * ``rmdir`` - remove directory

                * ``del`` - delete file
