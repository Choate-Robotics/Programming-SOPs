Welcome to the Choate Robotics Programming Documentation
========================================================

Choate Robotics Team 7407 Wired Boars is a FIRST Robotics Competition team based in Wallingford, CT. We are a student-run team that designs, builds, and programs a robot to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition. We joined in 2019. This documentation is our current Standard Operating Procedure for programming the robot. It is a work in progress, and we are always looking for ways to improve it. If you have any suggestions, please submit a pull request.
